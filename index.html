          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>
            I've been an avid gamer for as long as I can remember. I started
            gaming when I was about 4 years old on the NES or Nintendo
            Entertainment System and I haven't stopped since. The first video game that I fell in love with was Final Fantasy VII, I played that game every day. I replayed it several times from start to finish. Since then I've pushed for rank 1 in several games and achieved it in a few of them. From shooters to ARPG's to MMORPG's, if you can compete in it, I've tried for rank 1!

          <h3>Coffee!</h3>
          <p>
            I first started my coffee journey in 2013 by getting a job at my
            local Peet's Coffee and Tea. I worked at that location from
            2013-2016 and learned everything I possibly could from the baristas
            around me. First came the coffee knowledge, what coffees from
            different regions tasted like and specific flavor profiles. Second
            came all of the espresso bar knowledge, how to time shots for the
            perfect flavor, how to steam milk to the pefect temperature and foam
            composition and finally how to properly mix drinks so all of the
            flavor is despersed evenly. Finally came the latte art! one of my
            favorite parts about working with coffee. It was definitely one of
            the hardest things to learn to do but once you get the basics down,
            it becomes almost like second nature, you make hearts on every latte
            without even thinking about it.
